## Project Description

- Our Interactive Banking Website seeks to help users manage and view their banking information in an entirely different way. Interactive Banking will allow users to
view all of their banking institutions in one place with the help of Plaid API. Plaid is a financial technology company that provides a platform for connecting user banks accounts to third-party financial applications. Plaid also offers a secure and reliable way for users to share their financial data with apps and services through encryption, multi-factor authentication, tokenization, and monitorization. Our team will implement a database that will help manage the users data securely and efficiently to avoid the large amount of API calls to Plaid.

## Project Components

- Plaid API integration: In order to connect to the Plaid API and retrieve financial data, we will need to set up authentication and handle API requests and responses.
- Front-end development: We will use HTML and CSS to create the user interface for our web application. This will involve designing the layout of the website and adding styling and visual elements to create an engaging and user-friendly experience.
- Back-end development: We plan on creating a database to store user data and financial information. We will also need to write queries to interact with the database and retrieve and update data as needed.
- Integration of front-end and back-end: We will need to connect our front-end and back-end code to ensure that data is properly displayed and updated in the user interface. This will involve creating API endpoints and handling requests and responses between the two components.
- Testing and debugging: We will need to test our code thoroughly to ensure that it functions as expected and is free of bugs and errors. This will involve writing unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to validate the functionality of our application.
